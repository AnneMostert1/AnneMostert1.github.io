    <p>Hi! My name is Anne Mostert, it is nice to meet you! 
        <p>I joined the master programme <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/dfi/msc-design-for-interaction" target="_blank">Design for Interaction</a> at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the TU Delft this year.</p> 
        <p>I am interested in social design, solving social issues and doing so by focussing on the user and their needs, emotions and motives. I love getting to know the user deeply by interviewing and observing and work together with them on designing products, services and systems.</p>
        <p>My goal is to help people transition into more eco-friendly and socially equal behavior. I like to focus on social and seamless design in order to create a more sustainable future.</p> 
        <p>Visualizing and communicating design is my main strong suit. Next to that, I am good at doing research, I am a good listener and I can analyse data well. Furthermore, I am familiar with different ideation techniques for creative problem solving and thinking outside of the box.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am looking for a bussiness where I can do my graduation project, feel free to contact me!</p>
